      Oh dear... It's been another 2 months now, and... uhh.. a lot has happened. Hope this goes well: I'm typing this a few days before it goes public, so I have more time to develop it.

    <h3>October 1st, 2023</h3>

    <h4>Studio Comments are Uncapped</h4>

    <p>
      After two whole days, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/dimayajonelcid">BCMGF1137/19</a> re-enables comments on the studio. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> replies to this with a StackOverflowError joke, where instead of an actual Stack Overflow, it's that StackOverflow is currently offline.
    </p>

    <h3>October 2nd, 2023</h3>

    <p>Sadly, we had no news about H today ):</p>

    <h3>October 3rd, 2023</h3>

    <h4>Warning on Fake HTSTW (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/902636164">H4,177</a>)</h4>

    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> warns people that on BombCraft's <a href="https://hts-the-website-but-better.cityoftabletownohio.repl.co/">fake HTSTW</a>, he says that the <b>REAL</b> HTSTW has several spelling, grammatical, and factual errors. He reminds people that there are no spelling or grammatical issues (beyond mistakes that everyone makes), and that this has been fact checked several times.</p>

    <h3>October 4th, 2023</h3>

    <p>BombCraft really IS acting like a seven to ten year old now...</p>
 
    <h4>BombCraft "Reminds" <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> of His Errors</h4>
    
    <p>
      BombCraft tries to "remind" <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> that he can't spell or write, which is not true. He wrote an entire essay on his Ordinal Markup progress: and it wasn't for school! I haven't worked on it in a while, and sadly, it's on a school account, so I can't actually show it to you.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      He told <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> that he misspelt "maturity" as "maturaty": we all make these mistakes. They happen. We don't blow them out of proportion
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> Reminds BombCraft That Misspelling Long Words is Misspelling Long Words (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/902907367">H4,181</a>)</h4>

    <p>
      Misspelling long words happens all the time: specially a word you aren't familiar with. So, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> makes <b>A SECOND</b> H talking about BombCraft's fake HTSTW. He also goes out to fix that typo which everyone makes at some point. It's to misspelling "minuscule" as "miniscule", he uses as an example.
    </p>

    <h4>BombCraft Says That <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a>'s "Fake" HTSTW Has Exactly Twenty-Six Errors</h4>

    <p>
      Oh my GOSH, why does BombCraft <b>NEVER</b> learn his lesson that he'll <b>NEVER</b> be unbanned from H?! Anyways, BombCraft makes a site compiling every mistake he finds in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a>'s "fake" HTSTW. Seriously, he should stop calling the real HTSTW fake! He counts twenty-six, including twenty-two FALSE errors! Even back then! The only ACTUAL errors are that "proceed" was mispelled as "procced", the "should of"-"you're" pair, and "thos", both in the explanation for question twenty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything else is pure BS by BombCraft against <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a>, like how he can't spell (which is fake, as we all know), or how he was banned June 12th (which was impossible to know because as far as they knew, he could of been inable to use his chromebook at school and then had homework to do)
    </p>

    <h4>The Truth... (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/902974233">H4,183</a>)</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> <b>DEBUNKS</b> BombCraft's "errors" in the REAL HTSTW on the site he made. He talks about:
      <ul>
        <li>That he writes it "uncannon"</li>
        <li>That those spelling mistakes in the explanation for question twenty-two were almost certainly intentional</li>
        <li>That H3K happened in January</li>
        <li>He always writes triple "tripple" in the context of GD</li>
        <li>He wrote up the June 18th article on a chromebook</li>
        <li>That May 27th was the date of the Discord announcement</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.chess.com/blog/HTheSeries/i-know-how-it-is-written">i know how it is written</a></h4>

    <p>
      BombCraft then makes a <a href="https://chess.com">Chess.com</a> blog <b>DEBUNKING BACK</b> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a>'s project, saying that it is horrible. The banner was also <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/701344583/">stolen from this project</a>, which straight up doesn't count because handwriting, particularly with a pen, cannot be fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> then says, and I quote:

      <blockquote>
        <p>STOP IT WITH THE STUPID LIES, WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID.</p>
        <p>ALSO I KNOW WHERE YOU STOLE THAT IMAGE FROM, THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE, BAD HANDWRITTING HAPPENS.</p>
      </blockquote>

      - <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/dodecahedron1296">dodecahedron1296</a>
    </p>

    <h4>BombCraft finally realizes what he did</h4>

    <p>
      BombCraft, after <b>EIGHT ENTIRE MONTHS</b>, finally realizes that what he did was bad and should of never happened. He, on his GD profiles, says he should stop being so impusive. He then also deletes the site with now twenty-five errors and the blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      He DOES tell to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> that he should update his <a href="https://chess.com">Chess.com</a> profile to say that he's now twelve. And he also starts to post comments on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> (GD 30IGeometryDash)'s levels... which doesn't work! All <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> does is delete BombCraft's comments on his levels and dislike bomb every other thing on GD he's ever made.
    </p>

    <h3>October 5th, 2023</h3>

    <h4><i>(continued)</i> BombCraft finally realizes what he did</h4>

    <p>
      BombCraft then tells him to update his Fandom profile, saying that he founf it after Googling <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/589294927/">JSBomb</a>. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuickCoderLongJumper">30IS</a> was conviently going to go onto the <a href="https://conlang.fandom.com/wiki/">Conlang Fandom</a>, and fixed it there. He ALSO updated his age on his profile page on that fandom, because it also still said he waws eleven. Seriously, people just forget to update his or her age on websites!
    </p>
