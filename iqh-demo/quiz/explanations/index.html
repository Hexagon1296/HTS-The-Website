  <h2>Explanations And Credits</h2>
  
  <p>Well done, you! You beat the quiz! Hopefully you didn't CHEAT in some way... You are probably wondering, "Why is the answer to "DISPLAY" "UH UH"?" Or... 
 "Why does a 2-second bomb question exist?" Hopefully, I can answer these questions, just as you did with mine.</p>

      <td>How do you participate in H: The Series?</td>
      <td>Just make a project</td>
      <td>Any project could do, so long as it can attract people. It should NOT be against the Scratch TOS or low-effort. This also parodies the third question of the GD Impossible Quiz, where "You Don't" is the correct answer. HOWEVER, that option implies that NO ONE can join H, while the truth is almost entirely the opposite.</td>

      <td>Daily271</td>
      <td>When you do the calculations, Daily was born in 2012, which is a bigger number than 2011. This implies that the others were born before 2011. I'm NOT spoiling other years, though; you might want to figure them out for yourself.</td>

      <td>This is a possible news ticker if you play <a href="https://ivark.github.io/AntimatterDimensions/">Antimatter Dimensions</a> by Hevipelle. Notice the word "no" in the question, suggesting that this is NOT a Bee Movie reference (at least not directly).</td>

      <td>How many of each clean animal of each gender did Noah bring onto the Ark?</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>Before I explain the answer, you SHOULD know that BombCraft has been EXTREMELY HOSTILE against this question. But no way I'm removing this. Anyway, you might think the answer should have been 1. However, Noah was actually asked to bring <b>7</b> of each gender of each clean animal onto the Ark. It was the unclean animals that only 1 of each gender of each clean animal was brought. What's the difference between clean and unclean? Clean animals were allowed to be eaten (e.g. lamb, goat), while unclean animals were not allowed to be eaten.</td>

      <th>9</th>
      <td>How many holes in a tremolo?</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>If you play guitar, you might know about a tremolo, that is, where you reiterate a note consistently on a string. The top of the guitar has 8 holes with the tuners (the pegs create new holes), and one more with the hole on the big part. 8+1=9, so the answer is 9. It <em>is</em> actually the question number in this quiz, but not in the full version, which is why you can't click on the question number.</td>

      <td>DISPLAY [15.0 SECOND BOMB]</td>
      <td>UH UH</td>
      <td>This is a reference to Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, where you have to defuse the bomb. This comes from "Who's On First", and is hard to explain it all. Go to <a href = "https://www.bombmanual.com/web/index.html">this link</a> to see the full manual!<br>
      The general explanation for this case is this: The display is "DISPLAY". For this, we look on the bottom-right answer (middle left/right doesn't exist here... yet), and it is "WHAT?". Keep in mind there are TWO "WHAT"s: one <b>with</b> a question mark and one <b>without</b> a question mark. Then, it asks you to press the label that comes first in this list: YOU, HOLD, YOU'RE, YOUR, U, DONE, <u>UH UH</u>, LIKE, YOU ARE, UH HUH, UR, NEXT, WHAT?, SURE. "UH UH" comes first, therefore, that's the answer.

      <td>What happened to Lucca in class?</td>
      <td>He had to leave chem</td>
      <td>Lucca was a classmate in U.S. History when I was in 10th grade. There was one instance where he was absent, and I asked my friends about it before the starting bell rang. Turns out, he had to leave chemistry class. This is a very nonsensical question, but it's triggering. Therefore, I left it in. Oh, and a classmate named Dalton suggested that question.</td>

      <td>Slovakia and Slovenia</td>
      <td>Look closely: <u>Slov</u>akia and <u>Slov</u>enia. It's worth mentioning that this is NOT a typical Impossible Quiz question, and that it's not entirely trivia, but this one is. The 2-second bomb exists to compensate for this, so you can't easily tell what the question was.</td>

      <td>Tangle-Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer</td>
      <td>If you watched the Lego Movie (released in 2014), you (hopefully) know about Kragle, a weapon of mass destruction in the movie. The antagonist was going to spray it on Taco Tuesday, calling it "TAKOS" (note: the S is silent!) to bait everyone, standing for "Tangle-Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer". Wait a second... <b>DID I JUST SPOIL THE MOVIE?! :(</b></td>

      <td>Why do you even play this quiz? It's all just meta-references and stuff. Sure some are funny, but even THEY get so goshdarn OLD after 0.69 milliseconds.</td>
      <td>Disregard this question. There is no continent named "Asia".</td>
      <td>The sentence "There is no continent named "Asia"" comes from the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN1vEgurxTM">Mandela Effect EAS Scenario,</a> where Asia somehow gets wiped from reality. Anyway, nobody is supposed to know that I'm using meta-references, so you should all DISREGARD the question. (In an unrelated note, @IzzyConfusing BombCraft isn't NOT an H-maker. However, he IS a banned H-maker. Being an H-maker (Active/Inactive/Former/Banned) implies that the user made at least one H. (Side side note: I made that as a reference to a meta-reference, so I'm using meta-meta-references, Not...))</td>

      <td>S</td>
      <td>Before I start, I'll warn you of this: you have spent all of your life working normally and not having to worry about the books you read, but now your progress is defined by your ability to recall those books from as far as elementary school, and this quiz is VERY nitpicky... You should of paid attention more in you're Language Arts classes... <br><b>OH CARP.</b><br> Anyway, allow me to trouble you with some 3rd Grade literature. This comes from Roald Dahl's book, "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory". However, this specific scene was not shown in the movies! In this scene, Mike Teavee, jshrunk via television, is offerred a triple overdose of Wonka's Supervitamin Chocolate: "Supervitamin Chocolate contains huge amounts of vitamin A and vitamin B. It also contains vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin F, vitamin G, vitamin I, vitamin J, vitamin K, vitamin L, vitamin M, vitamin N, vitamin O, vitamin P, vitamin Q, vitamin R, vitamin T, vitamin U, vitamin V, vitamin W, vitamin X, vitamin Y, <em>and,</em> believe it or not, vitamin Z! The only two vitamins it doesn't have in it are <b>vitamin S, because it makes you sick, </b>and vitamin H, because it makes you grow horns on the top of your head, like a bull" (Dahl 158-159). Notice that Supervitamin Chocolate doesn't include vitamin S, so that's the correct answer.</td>

This question is ANOTHER literature reference, this time from the "My Weird School" series by Dan Gutman. The main character, nicknamed A.J. (his real name is Arlo, but he doesn't like being called that), calls the PTA "<u>P</u>arents who <u>T</u>alk <u>A</u> lot". This can also be viewed as a true statement because the Parent-Teacher Administration has consistent negotiations, so they do talk a lot.</td>
