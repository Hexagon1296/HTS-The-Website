    <h3>Apples and oranges round 2</h3>

    <p class="date">Posted Nov 20, 2023</p>

    <p>So, BombCraft has tried to say that my 10K project has broken the Community Guidelines because it discredited him. I stand with, however, that I did not break the Community Guidelines by discrediting him. You need to keep in mind the reason for discredit: calling me hurtful names. Also, how in the world does BombCraft not know about the apples and oranges fallacy? This is very secretive however. There is another possibility: being really mad. What you are saying is that because people being mad because they are treated unfairly or someones actions or acting immaturely both use all caps, they are the same. And we all know that's not true. "Being mad" is what is actually happening here: you are talking about actions from which we have banned you from. Also, if anything, BCMGF1137/19 is much more mature: and he uses all caps sometimes</p>

    <h3>BombCraft saying that my version has many grammatical mistakes but HE HIMSELF makes a grammatical error</h3>

    <p class="date">Posted Nov 20, 2023</p>

    <p>So, BombCraft has "apologized" for his actions, and there are a whole load of false claims in there! Also, remember back when BombCraft was talking about how many errors there were in the REAL HTS: The Website (this one)? Well, he literally made a grammatical error in his apology. See <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/927622324/">this H project</a> for the debunk. Also, no, I will <b>not</b> stop with the "the cake is a lie" references, in fact, it's what's behind the 10K secret.</p>

    <h3>Really, stop it with saying this is uncannon and has many errors, BOMBCRAFT... YOU GOTTA GET OUTTA MY LIFE... - BCMGF1137/19, probably</h3>

    <p class="date">Posted Oct 4, 2023</p>

    <p>I've already had to make THREE projects! THREE! just about how BombCraft's version is uncannon. ALL HE'S DONE IS SAY THAT MY VERSION IS TOTALLY UNCANNON AND HAS MANY ERRORS INSIDE OF IT. THERE AREN'T. Heck, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/902974233/">this project</a> disproves everything you said! Also, incomplete pages are NOT factual errors: they're just incomplete pages.</p>
